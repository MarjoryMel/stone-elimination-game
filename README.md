# Stone Elimination Game

This is my first project developed during my university course, using the C programming language. The goal of this project was to create a simple game to help learn and demonstrate the basic principles of programming in C.

## Game Instructions

### Starting the Game
When you start the game, you will be asked if you want to receive the game instructions. If you want to see the instructions, type 'S'. If you do not want to see the instructions, type 'N'.

**Enter (S/N): S**

To exit the game, enter 1 for both the origin and destination row/column.

### Game Rules
1. **Jumping Rules:**
   - A jump consists of moving any stone to an empty space.
   - The destination space must be diagonal to the origin space.
   - The stone cannot pass over other empty spaces to reach its destination.

### Difficulty Levels
The game has the following difficulty levels based on the number of stones eliminated:
- **Extremely Easy:** Eliminate up to 29 stones.
- **Easy:** Eliminate between 30 and 39 stones.
- **Hard:** Eliminate between 40 and 44 stones.
- **Extremely Hard:** Eliminate between 45 and 47 stones.

## Project Details
- **Language:** C
- **File:** The project consists of a single file named `main.c`.
- **Purpose:** This project was created as an introduction to C programming, covering all the basic programming fundamentals.

## How to Compile and Run
To compile and run the game, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.c` file.
3. Compile the program using a C compiler like `gcc`:
   ```sh
   gcc -o stone_elimination_game main.c

4. Run the compiled program:
   ```sh
   ./stone_elimination_game

##  Learning Outcomes
This project helped me to learn:
- Basic syntax and structure of a C program.
- Fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and functions.
- How to handle user input and output in C.
- Basic game logic implementation.
